cramtools, version 0.2
Author: vadim@ebi.ac.uk

This is a set of Java tools and APIs for efficient compression of SRA data.


Usage. 
There is some help available by running cramtools <command> without arguments.

To convert a BAM file to CRAM: 
cramtools cram --input-bam-file <bam file>
		--reference-fasta <reference fasta file>
		[--output-cram-file <output cram file>]
		
To convert a CRAM file to BAM: 		
cramtools bam --input-cram <input cram file> 
		--reference <reference fasta file>
		--output-file <output bam file>

Notes:
1. reference fasta file must be indexed: 
samtools faidx <fasta file>
2. input bam file must be sorted by coordinate.
3. input bam file must be indexed.

Release notes.
Although this should be a stable version the code is released only as early access. 
A big part of the project is still experimental and will not be supported in the future.   
 
In this version there are a number of limitations: 
- unampped reads are ignored
- paired reads are treated as single
- input BAM file is read twice during conversion (first-pass is to collect statistics)
